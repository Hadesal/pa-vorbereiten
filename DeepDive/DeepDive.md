You have a html form with two `<input>` fields: name and meters. Below you have a button which says "add new score". Below there is a `<textarea>` which displays the scores (`ID=scores`). The button above it adds new score (`${name} -${score}`) to it if the score value is numeric. If not, it displays an error message via `alert()`.

Below the textarea there is another button which removes the line with the smallest score value from the records.

# Login Dialog (15)

Create a form with email and password fields and a submit button. Furthermore, an initially empty message box (`<span>`, `ID=messagebox`) should be available. If the email is valid and the password is longer than 10 characters, the message "Account created" should be displayed in green (via CSS class "good-msg") in the message box. Otherwise the reason should be displayed in red in the message box (CSS class "fail-msg"). The reason is either that the password is too short or the email is invalid.

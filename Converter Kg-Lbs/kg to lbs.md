# Converter (2)

You have a combobox with two options: "pounds -> kilos" and "kilos -> pounds". Further you have two input boxes, one labeled "from" and the other "to". Implement JS functionality that will do the conversion. On change in the combobox, both input fields should be put to zero. Please make sure all results are padded to three decimal places. 

Remember the highest weight value inserted and output it in kilos a `<div>` element below all the other UI elements.

Refactor the code and factorize functions `toPounds(kilos)` and `toKilos(pounds)` if you have not already done so.
